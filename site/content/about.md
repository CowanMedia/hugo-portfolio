I'm currently exploring full-stack web development and I enjoy working as part of a collaborative team. An experienced program manager, I can balance multiple projects. Co-workers describe me as someone who is friendly, easy to get along with, teachable, responsible, and able to meet deadlines. I'm the type of person that plays well with others.

Currently, I am working as the Senior Manager of Marketing Communications for a company in Denver, and I do freelance web design and development on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~011ed5b86fbba50a79/).
