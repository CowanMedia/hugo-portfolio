“Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.”
― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

I know I just said that I just can't deal with a CMS like Wordpress... but how to deal with the problem of clients maintaining site content? I really hate dealing with that even more.

Netlify also offers NetlifyCMS, which is an open source content management for static sites and provides an editing interface for content. [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). I love this, and I've been playing around with it with no troubles so far. 

It's a beautiful thing and it's even free. You just pick a static site template and deploy the NetlifyCMS in one click.

To use the CMS interface, or for your clients to use it - it's super easy - just add "admin" after your site name to login into the CMS interface:
1) Example https://www.yoursitename.com/admin
2) click on the "Login with Netlify Identity" - Netlify also has an identity service for handling authentication. [Netlify Indentity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/)
3) edit content on your site

That's it. I'll post a sample site using NetlifyCMS when I'm done.
