In the spirit of simple websites, I've come across [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) for css. The founding principles are spot on - 100% responsive, high-performing and readable regardless of device, screen size, or browser. Modular. A commitment to accessibility, providing tools to make it easy to implement. And open source. 

Again, still learning.
