"When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on."
- Franklin D. Roosevelt

So, I've really liked what I've read about static websites. And I've had nothing but a great experience using Netlify. Netlify seems too good to be true. After struggling with a CMS, namely - WordPress, it just seems like static sites are really what I need most of the time. And why deal with such a massive headache that comes from Wordpress. I determined to learn how to get better at using a static site generator, like Hugo.

Great article on Netlify about this [the reign of static site generators](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/12/the-reign-of-static-site-generators-/).
